# Edward-Online-ERP-for-beauty-salons
Updated 24.3.2016

Edwars is an Online ERP system to streamline and help beauty salon business management and accounting / reporting.

I would like to rely on Google platform as much as possible to utilize authentication and services, ie. calendar for reservations and
calendar sharing amongst the company.

[Front-End]
Currently working on the UX / UI part of the product, constructing navigation and responsiveness as I go.

[Backend]
Really would like help on the database / data handling part. Testing Lovefield as a viable solution for data handling on web-application.
Need to construct reporting service to enable with automatic alerts (product requires reordering) []
Database for all recorded assets
